- defines how elements are displayed on a web-page and how they are sized
- each box has 
    - content - text,images etc
    - border - around the element(technically inside element)
    - padding - invisible space around the content, 
                technically inside the element (space b/w content and border or outermost part of elemet)
    - margin - space outside element (create space b/w elements)
    - fill-area - text content or images are inside content box, but, 
                background image or color occupy entire visible part of content area 
                (including padding and border area not margin)

- final width of element = lb+lp+width+rp+rb
- final height of element = tb+tp+height+bp+bb
- margin is not part of calculations(its just space around element)
