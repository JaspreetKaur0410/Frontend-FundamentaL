Conflicting selectors -
if multiple elements selecting the same element - all rules apply
in case, conflicting rules occur - order of selection ---> 
            1) id(last selector in code applied if multiple ids)
            2) class(last selector in code applied if multiple classes)
            3) element selector(last selector in code applied if multiple times occurred in code)
            4) universal selector(*)


important keyword - highest priority - not a good practise though
psudeo-class have more priority than just the element
