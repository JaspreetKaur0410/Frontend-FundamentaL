Normal Flow ->
    - default
    - position:relative
    
Absolute positioning ->
    - no impact on surrounding elements, might overlap them
    - position:absolute
    - we use top,bottom,left or right to offset the element from its relatively positioned container

NOTE ->
    the first parent element that has positioned set to relative 
    from which the absolutely positioned element will be placed
